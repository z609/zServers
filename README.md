# zServers
zServers is a plugin built on-top of PaperSpigot 1.12, and provides you the ability to setup individual "servers" from within a single PaperSpigot host. It is Redis-backed, and provides support for TimoCloud as well, so you can scale as long as you have the hardware to back it. zServers is made for minigame servers, with customizable templates and world loading, as well as an API similar to that of CraftBukkit as well. It also supports updates on the fly, allowing you to drop your zServers modules into a central modules directory and have all your servers update automatically, without restarting PaperSpigot. Not only that, it's entirely de-centralized - meaning, you don't need to run a separate process for zServers to function. Each server runs its own instance, and will make calculations on-the-fly. zServers has its own wrappers for its zModules, so you can listen for Bukkit events without boilerplate. zServers requires PaperSpigot for asynchronous chunk loading, so make sure you're using the Paper runtime. It has been tested against 1.12 only, so use wisely or fork it and make your own with reflection.
